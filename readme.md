#Obcento: PHP Utility for Twitter 1.1 REST API
----------------------------------------------------------
Obcento is a nice, lightweight, and medium-featured PHP library for communicating with Twitter via their 1.1 REST API. It uses OAuth and provides many functions for reading stuff.

Also, 'obcento' is a cool Latin word for singing and serenading. Which is kinda like Twitter. Ish. It's also easy to misspell. So have fun :)


Requirements
------------------
- PHP (version 5 or better)
- cURL extension


Usage
------------------
You will need to get some credentials from Twitter. You'll need four things.
 - Consumer Key
 - Consumer Secret
 - Access Token
 - Access Token Secret

Just go to [dev.twitter.com/apps](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) and follow the instructions there. You can pass them into the constructor fairly easily. Check out examples.php for how to do this.
